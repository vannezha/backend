// there are 3 type of command to declaring a variable in js (var, let, const)
// but var rarely used anymore because its more buggy than others

let a = 12
a = 13
console.log(a)

const b = 12
// b = 13 // throw an error because constant
console.log(b)

// const c; // error as well because const must have initial value
// c = 12
